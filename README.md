# Shopping-cart-system
This code represents a simple shopping cart system. It defines two classes: Product and ShoppingCart. The Product class represents a product with a name and price, while the ShoppingCart class manages a list of items and provides methods for adding/removing items, calculating the total price, and printing the items.
